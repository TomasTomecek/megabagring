This is our favourite breakfast - vegan omelette with veggies from our fridge.
The best thing about this meal is that you can swap ingredients and seasoning
with things you like or have available.

You may have noticed that I haven't put any measures here - this is my style of
cooking, I don't measure :)


## Let's do it!

![Turnip and pepper chopping](/winter-omelette/turnip-and-pepper.jpg)

1. Heat up your pan and use your favourite oil (rice oil) in our case.

2. Put ingredients in the pan as you like (1-7): you may want to fry the onion a bit.

3. Once things are a little squishy, season the meal up!

4. You can put peanuts in right after the spices, fry some more.

5. Once you like how the ingredients are cooked, put hraška to the mix with a bit of water so it's moisty and resembles eggs.

6. Mix all together well.

7. Stop cooking once you're satisfied, sprinkle the top with sesame and chia seeds.
