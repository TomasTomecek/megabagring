Peťka ❤️ this meal so much. It's her absolute favorite.

The biggest problem with this food is to cook "just enough" because if you cook too much, you can't stop eating it.

You may have noticed that I haven't put any measures here - this is my style of
cooking, I don't measure :)

Also, are you hungry?


## Time to cook something delicious.

1. Cook the pasta - boil some salted water, put the pasta in, wait for it to become cooked, rinse the water and keep a little bit in; finally — apply the pumpkin seed oil.

2. Now we want to make the cream, so put the yoghurt and the peanut butter in the pot with the pasta, stir and cook lightly. You should be getting consistency of a melted cheese.

3. Chop the pear and the banana, put them in together with the berries and nuts.

4. Wait until... You like what you see :)

5. Add chocolate so it melts (this is the best part!).

6. Sprinkle with seeds and coconut.
